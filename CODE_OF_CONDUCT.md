# Vision

The Code of Conduct is not originally the place to describe the vision, but I wanted the contributors to be aware of the vision and to act accordingly, so I have included it at the beginning.

This project is to create **sensible robots that live with people** like “Doraemon” and “Astro Boy”.

# Code of conduct

## Use kind and polite language

Use kind and polite words to avoid needlessly hurting the other person.

## Basically, relax and let's proceed.

The author himself is one, but it is not a good idea to do so in a stressful situation with too much rooting around. Relax and enjoy the process.

## Let's have fun!

The best part of this project is the thrill of not knowing what you will be able to create. Let's have fun while trying things out.
